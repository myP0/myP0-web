# myP0

> A personal productivity app that keeps your data in your Google account. No servers, no tracking, fully open source.

myP0 is a privacy-first productivity tool that unifies tasks, notes, and calendar in one interface. All data stays in the user's Google account — the app is a stateless frontend with no backend database.

## Core Features

- **Google Tasks integration**: Manage tasks synced with Google Tasks
- **Block editor with Drive sync**: Rich note-taking powered by Tiptap, stored in Google Drive appDataFolder
- **Google Calendar view**: See events alongside tasks and notes
- **Offline-first**: Instant local saves via IndexedDB, background sync to Google Drive
- **No backend**: PKCE OAuth authentication runs entirely in the browser
- **PWA**: Installable on any device, Android app via Play Store (TWA)
- **Open source**: MIT License, fully auditable

## Architecture

- SvelteKit static site (SSG for marketing/blog, SPA for the app)
- IndexedDB for local persistence, Google Drive appDataFolder for remote sync
- PKCE OAuth — no client secret, no server token exchange
- Single AWS Lambda for push notifications (only server component)
