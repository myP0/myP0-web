# myP0 - Complete Reference

> A personal productivity app that keeps your data in your Google account. No servers, no tracking, fully open source.

## What is myP0?

myP0 is a personal productivity application built around data ownership and minimal infrastructure. The core principle: Google Workspace acts as the backend while the app remains a stateless frontend. Users maintain full control of their data within the Google ecosystem.

Key values:
- Data sovereignty (user owns all data in their Google account)
- Minimal infrastructure (no database, no server state)
- Offline-first (works without internet)
- Transparency (open source, MIT License)

## How It Works

1. **Sign in with Google** — Authenticate directly in your browser using PKCE OAuth. No passwords stored, no backend involved.
2. **Work locally** — All changes save instantly to IndexedDB. The app feels native because it is local.
3. **Sync to Drive** — Changes automatically sync to your Google Drive's hidden app folder.

## Data Flow

1. User action updates Svelte store
2. Store persists to IndexedDB immediately (instant feedback)
3. Debounced sync to Google Drive (3 second delay after last change)
4. On app load: hydrate from IndexedDB first, then background sync from Drive

Conflict resolution: Single-user app, last-write-wins with updatedAt timestamps.
